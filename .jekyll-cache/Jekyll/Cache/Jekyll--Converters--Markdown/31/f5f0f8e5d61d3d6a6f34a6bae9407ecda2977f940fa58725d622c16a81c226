I"‡<p>Last week, I had the wonderful opportunity to give a presentation to Iowa
Stateâ€™s Information Assurance Student Group (IASG). Months ago, when I was
meeting with the other IASG cabinet members to decide what weâ€™d all present on,
I floated the idea that I could present on physical security. After all, itâ€™s
something that Iâ€™m very interested in, I enjoy exposing other people to this
information, and itâ€™s something that just <em>does not</em> come up in our universityâ€™s
security curriculum. I was given the green light to talk about physical
security, though of course thatâ€™s like signing up to give a presentation on
â€œmathâ€ or â€œcomputersâ€. Itâ€™s a big world, and I wasnâ€™t sure what I wanted to
focus on. In the end, I decided not to focus on anything for the whole talk,
instead running through a handful of topics, concepts, and tools that I
personally think are really cool. My hope was to just get a few members of the
audience interested enough that theyâ€™d go home and research some more of these
cool ideas on their own, and based off of the feedback Iâ€™ve received since
giving the talk Iâ€™d say I was successful.</p>
